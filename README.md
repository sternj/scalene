# About Scalene

```
  % pip install -U scalene
```

Scalene is a high-performance CPU *and* memory profiler for Python that does a number of things that other Python profilers do not and cannot do.  It runs orders of magnitude faster than other profilers while delivering far more detailed information.

1. Scalene is _fast_. It uses sampling instead of instrumentation or relying on Python's tracing facilities. Its overhead is typically no more than 10-20% (and often less).
1. Scalene is _precise_. Unlike most other Python profilers, Scalene performs CPU profiling _at the line level_, pointing to the specific lines of code that are responsible for the execution time in your program. This level of detail can be much more useful than the function-level profiles returned by most profilers.
1. Scalene separates out time spent running in Python from time spent in native code (including libraries). Most Python programmers aren't going to optimize the performance of native code (which is usually either in the Python implementation or external libraries), so this helps developers focus their optimization efforts on the code they can actually improve.
1. Scalene _profiles memory usage_. In addition to tracking CPU usage, Scalene also points to the specific lines of code responsible for memory growth. It accomplishes this via an included specialized memory allocator.
1. Scalene produces _per-line_ memory profiles, making it easier to track down leaks.
1. Scalene profiles _copying volume_, making it easy to spot inadvertent copying, especially due to crossing Python/library boundaries (e.g., accidentally converting `numpy` arrays into Python arrays, and vice versa).
1. **NEW!** Scalene now reports the percentage of memory consumed by Python code vs. native code.
1. **NEW!** Scalene now highlights hotspots (code accounting for significant percentages of CPU time or memory allocation) in red, making them even easier to spot.
1. **NEW!** Scalene can produce reduced profiles (via `--reduced-profile`) that only report lines that consume more than 1% of CPU or perform at least 100 allocations.
1. **NEW!** Scalene now also supports `@profile` decorators to profile only specific functions.

# Comparison to Other Profilers

## Performance and Features

Below is a table comparing the **performance and features** of various profilers to Scalene.

![Performance and feature comparison](https://github.com/emeryberger/scalene/blob/master/images/profiler-comparison.png)

**Function-granularity profilers** report information only for an entire function, while **line-granularity profilers** (like Scalene) report information for every line

- **Time** is either real (wall-clock time), CPU-only, or both.
- **Efficiency**: :green_circle: = fast, :yellow_circle: = slower, :red_circle: = slowest
- **Mem Cons.**: tracks memory consumption
- **Unmodified Code**: works on unmodified code
- **Threads**: works correctly with threads
- **Python/C**: separately attributes Python/C time and memory consumption
- **Mem Trend**: shows memory usage trends over time
- **Copy Vol.**: reports _copy volume_, the amount of megabytes being copied per second

## Output

Scalene prints annotated source code for the program being profiled
(either as text or as HTML via the `--html` option) and any modules it
uses in the same directory or subdirectories (you can optionally have
it `--profile-all` and only include files with at least a
`--cpu-percent-threshold` of time).  Here is a snippet from
`pystone.py`.

![Example profile](https://github.com/emeryberger/scalene/blob/master/images/sample-profile-pystone.png)

* **Memory usage at the top**: Visualized by "sparklines", memory consumption over the runtime of the profiled code. Scalene is a statistical profiler, meaning that it does sampling, and variance can certainly happen. A longer-running program that allocates and frees more memory will have more stable results.
* **"CPU % Python"**: How much time was spent in Python code.
* **"CPU % Native"**: How much time was spent in non-Python code.
* **"Mem % Python"**: How much of the memory allocation happened on the Python side of the code, as opposed to in non-Python code (e.g. an extension written in C/C++).
* **"Net (MB)"**: Positive net memory numbers indicate total memory allocation in megabytes; negative net memory numbers indicate memory reclamation.
* **"Memory usage over time / %"**: Visualized by "sparklines", how much memory consumption was generated by this line over the program runtime, the percentages meaning **???**.
* **"Copy (MB/s)"**: The amount of megabytes being copied per second (see "About Scalene").

## Using `scalene`

The following command runs Scalene on a provided example program.

```
  % scalene test/testme.py
```

To see all the options, run with `--help`.

    % scalene --help
    usage: scalene [-h] [--outfile OUTFILE] [--html] [--reduced-profile]
                   [--profile-interval PROFILE_INTERVAL] [--cpu-only]
                   [--profile-all] [--use-virtual-time]
                   [--cpu-percent-threshold CPU_PERCENT_THRESHOLD]
                   [--cpu-sampling-rate CPU_SAMPLING_RATE]
                   [--malloc-threshold MALLOC_THRESHOLD]

            % scalene yourprogram.py
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --outfile OUTFILE     file to hold profiler output (default: stdout)
      --html                output as HTML (default: text)
      --reduced-profile     generate a reduced profile, with non-zero lines only (default: False).

                            output profiles every so many seconds.
      --cpu-only            only profile CPU time (default: profile CPU, memory, and copying)
      --profile-all         profile all executed code, not just the target program (default: only the target program)

You can install it as follows:
```
  % pip install -U scalene
```

or
```
  % python3 -m pip install -U scalene
```

### Homebrew (Mac OS X)

As an alternative to `pip`, you can use Homebrew to install the current version of Scalene from this repository:
